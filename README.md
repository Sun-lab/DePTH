### DePTH: Deep learning Prediction of TCR-HLA association


---

[![Python 3.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

DePTH is an open source software for sequence-based TCR (T cell receptor) and HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) association prediction.

A tutorial for DePTH package installation and usage is available at https://liusi2019.github.io/DePTH-tutorial/.

#### 10/07/2025 Update to DePTH 2.1

DePTH package is updated to version 2.1. Compared with DePTH 2.1, the changes are in the default models for HLA-I. For HLA-I, the default models shipped by the package are based on richer training data. For HLA-II, the default models shipped by the package are the same as those shipped by DePTH 2.0. 

#### 12/27/2024 Update to DePTH 2.0

DePTH package is updated to version 2.0. Compared with DePTH 1.0, for both HLA-I and HLA-II, the default models shipped by the package are based on richer training data. 

Details about the training data for DePTH 2.1 and DePTH 2.0 can be found in this paper:

#### DePTH 1.0

The DePTH 1.0 default models now are kept in the package as legacy. They can be loaded to make predictions by command line examples are shown near the end of the tutorial. Details about the training data for DePTH 1.0 can be found in this paper:
