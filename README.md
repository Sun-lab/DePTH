DePTH is an open source software for sequence-based TCR (T cell receptor) and HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) association prediction.

A tutorial for DePTH package installation and usage is available at https://liusi2019.github.io/DePTH-tutorial/.

#### 12/27/2024 Update to DePTH2.0

DePTH package is updated to version 2.0. The default models shipped by the package are now based on richer training data. Details about the training data can be found in this paper:
